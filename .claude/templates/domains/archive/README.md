# Archive

> Rest. Preserved but inactive.

Completed ventures, graduated experiments, old projects.

## What Goes Here

Anything that's done but worth keeping:

```
archive/
├── ventures/
│   └── old-company/     # Mirrors original path
├── experiments/
│   └── failed-idea/
└── life/
    └── old-area/
```

## The Rule

Archive mirrors the original structure. When you archive:

```
ventures/mycompany/ → archive/ventures/mycompany/
```

Path is preserved for context.

## Retrieval

Archives are searchable. Use `/alive:recall` to find old context.
