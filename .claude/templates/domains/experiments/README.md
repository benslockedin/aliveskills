# Experiments

> Testing grounds. No business model yet.

Ideas being validated. If it works, promote to venture.

## What Goes Here

Each experiment is a subdomain:

```
experiments/
├── app-idea/
│   ├── _brain/       # Hypothesis, learnings
│   ├── _working/     # Prototypes
│   └── [areas]/      # Research, designs
└── side-project/
```

## Experiment vs Venture

| Experiment | Venture |
|------------|---------|
| Testing hypothesis | Proven model |
| No revenue intent yet | Revenue intent |
| Might fail | Committed |
| Learning | Building |

## Graduation

When an experiment validates:
1. Create venture: `ventures/newname/`
2. Move relevant files
3. Archive experiment: `archive/experiments/oldname/`
