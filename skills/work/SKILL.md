description: Load one venture, experiment, life area, or project's full context and start working — reads _brain/, surfaces tasks, and picks up where you left off. Use when the user says "work on X", "focus on X", "open X", "status of X", "continue", "resume", or "pick up where I left off".
plugin_version: "3.0.1"

# alive:work

Focus on ONE venture, experiment, life area, or project. Load context from its `_brain/` folder and show current state.

**Different from `/alive:daily`:** Work focuses on ONE unit. Daily shows EVERYTHING.

## UI Treatment

Uses the **ALIVE Shell** — one rounded box, three zones.

```

## Version Check (Before Main Flow)

Compare your `plugin_version` (from frontmatter above) against the user's system:

1. Read `{alive-root}/.claude/alive.local.yaml` → get `system_version`
2. If `system_version` is missing or different from your `plugin_version`:
   ```
   [!] System update available (plugin: 3.0.1, system: X.X.X)
       └─ Run /alive:upgrade to sync
   ```
3. Continue with skill — this is non-blocking, just a notice

---

## Flow

```dot
digraph do_flow {
    "Start" -> "User specified unit?";
    "User specified unit?" -> "Find unit" [label="yes"];
    "User specified unit?" -> "Check session-index" [label="no"];
    "Check session-index" -> "Offer recent unit" [label="found"];
    "Check session-index" -> "Ask which one" [label="empty"];
    "Find unit" -> "Check structure";
    "Offer recent unit" -> "Check structure";
    "Ask which one" -> "Check structure";
    "Check structure" -> "Offer upgrade" [label="_state/ found"];
    "Check structure" -> "cd into unit" [label="_brain/ OK"];
    "Offer upgrade" -> "cd into unit" [label="after upgrade"];
    "cd into unit" -> "Load _brain/";
    "Load _brain/" -> "Check freshness";
    "Check freshness" -> "Flag stale" [label="> 2 weeks"];
    "Check freshness" -> "Show summary" [label="fresh"];
    "Flag stale" -> "Show summary";
    "Show summary" -> "Offer actions";
}
```

## Step 1: Identify Unit

**User specifies unit:**
```
"work on acme" → 04_Ventures/acme/
"focus on health" → 02_Life/health/
```

**User says "continue" or "resume" (no unit specified):**
1. Read `.claude/state/session-index.jsonl`
2. Find most recent `status: "ongoing"` entry
3. Offer that:
```
▸ checking session-index...
  └─ Last session: 04_Ventures/alive-llc (yesterday, [breakthrough])

Continue with alive-llc?
[1] Yes
[2] Pick different one
```

**No session-index or no ongoing threads:**
```
No recent session found.

Which one?
[1] 04_Ventures/acme-agency
[2] 04_Ventures/side-project
[3] 05_Experiments/new-idea
```

**Multiple matches:**
```
"work on beta" matches:
[1] 04_Ventures/beta
[2] 05_Experiments/beta-test

Which one?
```

## Step 2: Check Structure (v1 Detection)

Before loading, check if unit uses v1 structure:

```
Check: Does {unit}/_state/ exist? (should be _brain/)
```

If v1 detected:
```
[!] 04_Ventures/acme uses v1 structure (_state/)

Upgrade to v2?
[1] Yes, upgrade now
[2] No, continue with v1
```

If yes → invoke `/alive:upgrade` with this unit, then continue.
If no → use `_state/` paths for this session.

## Step 2.5: Change to Unit Directory (MANDATORY)

**Before loading context, `cd` into the unit directory:**

```bash
cd {alive-root}/{unit}/
```

For example:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/alive/04_Ventures/acme-agency/
```

**Why this matters:**
- Claude's system context automatically reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md` from the working directory
- Local `CLAUDE.md` files get picked up
- All relative paths in the session work correctly
- The unit becomes the "home base" for the session

**Show the change:**
```
▸ cd 04_Ventures/acme-agency/
  └─ Working directory set
```

## Step 3: Load Context (MANDATORY — All 4 Files)

**You MUST read all 4 files. Do not skip any.**

Read in order:
1. `{unit}/_brain/status.md` — Phase and focus
2. `{unit}/_brain/tasks.md` — Work queue
3. `{unit}/_brain/manifest.json` — Structure map
4. `{unit}/_brain/changelog.md` — **First 200 lines** (recent session history)

**The changelog is CRITICAL.** It contains:
- What happened in recent sessions
- Decisions made and why
- Context that won't be in status.md
- Where we left off last time

**Why first 200 lines?** The save skill **prepends** new entries (most recent first). So the top of the file has the newest sessions.

**Show retrieval paths:**
```
▸ reading 04_Ventures/acme/_brain/status.md
  └─ Phase: Building (updated 2 days ago)

▸ reading 04_Ventures/acme/_brain/tasks.md
  └─ 7 tasks, 2 @urgent

▸ reading 04_Ventures/acme/_brain/manifest.json
  └─ 12 files tracked, 3 references

▸ reading 04_Ventures/acme/_brain/changelog.md (first 200 lines)
  └─ Last session: 2026-02-04 — Plugin UI updates
```

**Implementation:**
```
Read(file_path: "{unit}/_brain/changelog.md", limit: 200)
```

**References:** If the manifest has a `references` array, mention the count to the user (e.g. "3 reference docs available"). Don't load the files — just surface awareness. Users can ask to read specific references on demand.

## Step 4: Check Freshness

Check `updated` date in manifest.json or file timestamps:

| Age | Action |
|-----|--------|
| < 2 weeks | Proceed normally |
| 2-4 weeks | Flag: `[!] Status is X days old. Still accurate?` |
| > 4 weeks | Warn + ask: `[!!] Status is very stale. Update before working?` |

```
[!] 04_Ventures/acme/_brain/status.md is 3 weeks old
    └─ Still accurate? [y] continue  [u] update first
```

## Step 5: Show Summary

**Always show the full summary — status, tasks, and any pending handoffs.**

Handoffs are part of the overview, not a blocking gate. But they should be **prominent** — a pending handoff means a previous session left unfinished work, and the user should know about it.

### Check manifest.handoffs[]

After loading `manifest.json` in Step 3, check the `handoffs` array:

```json
{
  "handoffs": [
    {
      "session_id": "abc12345",
      "date": "2026-02-02",
      "reason": "pre-compact",
      "thread": "ongoing",
      "file": "_working/sessions/plugin-feedback-abc12345-2026-02-02.md",
      "summary": "Brief description of what was in progress"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry represents an unfinished session with context that would otherwise be lost.

```

**Key details:**
- Show the `[!]` flag to draw attention
- Include the `summary` from each handoff entry so the user knows what's in each one
- Show the `reason` (context compact, resuming later) and `date`
- Handoffs appear BEFORE tasks — they represent prior work that may be more relevant than the task list

**If no handoffs:** Omit the HANDOFFS section entirely. Don't show "0 handoffs".

**If only handoffs, no tasks:** Show handoffs and note "No tasks in queue."

**If handoffs exist, nudge the user:**
```
[!] You have 2 pending handoffs from previous sessions.
    These contain context that would otherwise be lost.
    Pick [r1] or [r2] to resume, or choose a task to start fresh.
```

## Step 6: Offer Actions

Every actionable item gets a number. Handoffs appear alongside tasks:

Tasks and handoffs appear in the main content zone (see Summary Display above). Handoffs are surfaced inline:

```
│  [!] Handoff from Feb 2 — Landing page wireframes        │
│      r) resume this session                              │
```

**If no handoffs:** Omit the handoff section.

## Resuming a Handoff

When the user picks a handoff (e.g. `r1` or "resume the plugin feedback session"):

1. **Read the handoff document** into memory
2. **Archive immediately** — move file to `01_Archive/{unit-path}/sessions/` and remove from `manifest.handoffs[]`:
   ```
   ▸ loading handoff...
     └─ Reading _working/sessions/plugin-feedback-abc12345-2026-02-02.md

   ▸ archiving handoff (already read)...
     └─ Moving to 01_Archive/{unit-path}/sessions/
     └─ Removing from manifest.handoffs[]

   ✓ Handoff archived — context loaded
   ```
3. **Present the context** from the handoff — current state, decisions, and next steps
4. Continue working from where the handoff left off

**Why archive immediately?** The handoff's job is done once read. "Archive later" gets forgotten 100% of the time. Archive on read = 100% adherence.

**If user picks a task instead of a handoff:** Proceed normally. Handoffs stay in manifest until explicitly resumed or cleaned up by `/alive:sweep`.

## Edge Cases

**Unit doesn't exist:**
```
✗ 04_Ventures/acme/ not found

[1] Create 04_Ventures/acme/ (→ /alive:new)
[2] Show available ventures and experiments
```

**No _brain/ or _state/ folder:**
```
[!] 04_Ventures/acme/ exists but has no context folder

Initialize _brain/ now?
[1] Yes, initialize
[2] Cancel
```

## After Loading

- Stay scoped to this unit (don't read other units)
- Track changes for session
- When done → `/alive:save`

## Related Skills

- `/alive:daily` — See ALL ventures and experiments
- `/alive:save` — End session
- `/alive:new` — Create venture, experiment, life area, or project
- `/alive:upgrade` — Migrate v1 → v2
- `/alive:handoff` — Session continuity (creates handoff docs for resumption)
