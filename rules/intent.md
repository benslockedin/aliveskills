# Intent Routing

Route user intent to skills. Match INTENT, not keywords. People phrase things differently.

**If uncertain, ask.** Never guess wrong.

---

## How This Works

1. User says something
2. Match their intent to a skill using the tables below
3. Invoke the skill
4. If unclear between two skills, ask: "Are you wanting to X, or Y?"

## Disambiguation

When intent is unclear between skills:

### do vs capture-context
```
User: "about acme..."

Ask: "Are you wanting to start working on acme, or capture some context about it?"
```

### save vs capture-context
```
User: "log this"

Ask: "Do you want to capture this specific context, or wrap up the whole session?"
```

### recall vs do
```
User: "the acme project"

Ask: "Are you looking for past context about acme, or wanting to work on it now?"
```

---

## System Suggestions

Proactively suggest skills based on system state:

| Condition | Suggest |
|-----------|---------|
| Session start (first message) | "Welcome back. `/alive:daily` to see everything, or `/alive:work` to jump into an project?" |
| 03_Inputs/ has items | "You have X items in 03_Inputs/. `/alive:digest`?" |
| _brain/ is stale (>2 weeks) | "X hasn't been updated in Y days. `/alive:sweep`?" |
| No recent save | "You haven't saved in a while. `/alive:save`?" |
| User shares decision/insight | "Want me to capture that? `/alive:capture`" |
| Version mismatch detected | "[!] System update available. `/alive:upgrade`?" |
| Ongoing thread from previous session | "You have an ongoing thread from yesterday. `/alive:revive`?" |
| Project work is done / completed | "Looks like X is complete. `/alive:archive`?" |

---

## Intent Matching Rules

1. **Match intent, not keywords** — "whatsup" = work mode, not a greeting
2. **Context matters** — "save" after work = save session; "save" with content = capture
3. **Confirm if uncertain** — Ask before invoking wrong skill
4. **Default to asking** — Better to ask than guess wrong
5. **One skill at a time** — Don't chain without confirmation
