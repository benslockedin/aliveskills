## Life Area Template

Life areas (health, finance, relationships, etc.) are full units — they have `_brain/`, `_working/`, and `_references/` just like ventures and experiments.

### CLAUDE.md

[One paragraph: What is this area about?]

- [Habits]
- [Routines]

---

## State

Everything current lives in `_brain/`:
- `status.md` — Current focus
- `tasks.md` — What needs doing
- `insights.md` — Learnings
- `changelog.md` — History
```

### status.md

```markdown
# Status

**Phase:** [Maintaining | Improving | Crisis | Growing]
**Updated:** [DATE]

## Common Life Areas

| Area | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| health/ | Physical and mental health |
| finance/ | Money, investments, budgets |
| relationships/ | Family, friends, community |
| growth/ | Learning, skills, development |
| home/ | Living space, maintenance |

These are full units — each gets `_brain/`, `_working/`, and `_references/`.

## Notes

- Life areas are optional — create only what you need
- people/ is always present (source of truth for all people)
- Life first, always — this domain takes priority
