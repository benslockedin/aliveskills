# Inputs

> Everything lands here first.

Universal input. Triage regularly.

## What Goes Here

- Quick captures
- Things you're not sure where to put
- External context (transcripts, notes, links)
- Anything awaiting processing

## The Rule

Inputs is temporary. Nothing lives here permanently.

Process with `/alive:digest`:
1. Extract tasks → route to project
2. Extract insights → route to project
3. Extract decisions → route to changelog
4. Archive or delete the rest

## Structure

```
03_Inputs/
├── 2026-01-26-meeting-notes.md
├── quick-idea.md
└── link-to-check.md
```

Flat structure. Date-prefix optional but helpful.
