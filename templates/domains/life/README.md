# Life

> Life first, always.

This is the foundation. Everything else flows from here.

## What Goes Here

- **Plans & intentions** — What you're working toward
- **Patterns & behaviors** — How you operate
- **People** — Relationships (source of truth in `people/`)
- **Areas** — Health, finance, relationships, growth

## Structure

```
02_Life/
├── _brain/           # Your life's context
├── _working/         # In-progress personal stuff
├── _references/      # Reference materials
├── people/           # Everyone you know
└── [areas]/          # Health, finance, etc.
```

## Key Principle

Ventures and experiments are your life *online*. They're expressions of life, not separate from it.
