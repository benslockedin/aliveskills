# Experiments

> Testing grounds. No business model yet.

Ideas being validated. If it works, promote to venture.

## What Goes Here

Each experiment is its own unit:

```
05_Experiments/
├── app-idea/
│   ├── _brain/       # Hypothesis, learnings
│   ├── _working/     # Prototypes
│   ├── _references/  # Reference materials
│   └── [areas]/      # Research, designs
└── side-hustle/
```

## Experiment vs Venture

| Experiment | Venture |
|------------|---------|
| Testing hypothesis | Proven model |
| No revenue intent yet | Revenue intent |
| Might fail | Committed |
| Learning | Building |
