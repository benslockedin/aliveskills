# Archive

> Rest. Preserved but inactive.

Completed ventures, graduated experiments, old projects.

## What Goes Here

Anything that's done but worth keeping:

```
01_Archive/
├── 04_Ventures/
│   └── old-company/     # Mirrors original path
├── 05_Experiments/
│   └── failed-idea/
└── 02_Life/
    └── old-area/
```

## The Rule

Archive mirrors the original structure. When you archive:

```
04_Ventures/mycompany/ → 01_Archive/04_Ventures/mycompany/
```

Path is preserved for context.

## Retrieval

Archives are searchable. Use `/alive:recall` to find old context.
